DayZ Chernarus - Devil´s Castle Outer Wall Restoration.
I had this idea for a restoration projekt at Devil´s Castle.

This has been tested on Xbox One. And hopefully this should work on PC and on PS as well.
However, if there is some errors or bugs with this file. Please feel free to email to 
hirumayoichi730@gmail.com with some screenshots.

So, the only things that are in this file is the following:

1: 16x Land_Castle_Wall1_20.


So, easiest way to find this is if you go to Radio Zenit and then keep going towards Grishino. Just don´t go past the church.
Before you get to the church at Grishino, there will be a dirt road on the right side of the road.
Follow that road till you see a land_misc_feedshack. Keep following that road untill you see a road to the left side with a pub house.
Follow that road and past the pub house building and then you should be there.

How to install this file to your server:
Go to your Custom folder for your server, upload the file.
Then go to your cfggameplay.json file, go to "objectSpawnersArr": [ and type in "./custom/DevilsCastleOuterWallRestoration.json"
and if you have more custom files then add an , after ...json" like this -> "./custom/DevilsCastleOuterWallRestoration.json", "./custom/anotherfile.json" .
After that just save the changes and then restart the server and if all is done right then your server has a new base area.

Thank you for reading this text.
I hope you like this store.
